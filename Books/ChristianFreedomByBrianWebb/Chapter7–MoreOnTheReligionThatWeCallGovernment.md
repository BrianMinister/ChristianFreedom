# Chapter 7: More on the religion that we call Government
## Government is as much of a religion as any other.
Let’s remember chapter 2, 1st Samuel 8, short version: Don’t create a king.

If that isn’t enough, let’s looks at modern leaders, as found in Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_have_been_considered_deities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_have_been_considered_deities)

### Imperial Cults

#### Egyptian pharaohs: 3050 – 30 BC

Egyptian pharaohs were kings of Ancient Egypt, and were considered gods by their culture. Their titles equated them with aspects of the likes of the hawk god Horus, the vulture goddess Nekhbet, and the cobra-goddess Wadjet. The Egyptians believed that when their Pharaoh died, he would continue to lead them in the next life, which is why his burial was grand and completed to perfection—to please him in the next life and ensure his immortality to protect his people. See List of pharaohs.

#### Naram-Sin: 2255 – 2119 BC

The first Mesopotamian king to claim divinity.

It was extinguished completely with the Theodosian decrees of the late 4th century.

#### Romulus and Remus (hero cult): 771–717

BC Founders of Rome, sons of Mars, Romulus served as first king. After his death, Romulus was defined as the god, Quirinus, the divine persona of the Roman people. He is now regarded as a mythological figure, and his name a back-formation from the name Rome, which may ultimately derive from a word for “river”. Some scholars, notably Andrea Carandini believe in the historicity of Romulus, in part because of the 1988 discovery of the Murus Romuli on the north slope of the Palatine Hill in Rome.

#### Siddhārtha Gautama Buddha: 563 BC(?)

#### Mary (mother of Jesus) : 300 CE In 300 AD

She was worshipped as a Mother Goddess in the Christian sect Collyridianism, which was found throughout the Arabian Peninsula. Collyridianism was made up mostly of women followers and female priests. Followers of Collyridianism were known to make bread and wheat offerings to the Virgin Mary, along with other sacrificial practices. The cult was heavily condemned as heretical and schismatic by other Christians and was preached against by Epiphanius of Salamis, who discussed the group in his recollective writings titled Panarion.

#### Guan Yu: 581 AD–618 AD

Guan Yu has been deified as early as the Sui Dynasty and is still popularly worshipped today among the Chinese people variedly as an indigenous Chinese deity, a bodhisattva in Buddhism and a guardian deity in Taoism. He is also held in high esteem in Confucianism. In Hong Kong both police and gangsters consider him a divine object of reverence. In certain schools of Taoism and Chinese Buddhism he has been deemed divine or semi-divine status. The reverence for him may date back to the Sui dynasty.

#### Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib: 599 AD–661 AD

According to the Alawite faith, Ali ibn Abi Talib is one member of a trinity (Ali-Muhammad-Salman the Persian) corresponding roughly to the Christian Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is considered to be the second emanation of God by Yarsan and the supreme deity in Ali-Illahism.

### Kanichi Otsuka: 1891

Shinreikyo states of its founder “God became one with a human body, appeared among humanity, and founded Shinreikyo.”

#### George Washington   1732–1799

Worshiped as a kami in Hawaiian Shinto shrines. In the United States Capitol dome, he is also depicted ascending into Heaven and becoming a god, in the famous painting called The Apotheosis of Washington.

Yes, even a painting, and our country’s hero worship is a form of Deification. But why stop there: Sports Heros, Militiary Heros, Actors, Politicians, and all of the other public figures. YOU, yes, YOU the reader, if you recognize them for more than just being human, YOU are practicing idolatry. You are deifying people, people who are no better by the flesh than you or another other person around you. This is the root of the reason people search out to have a ruler, a king, a slave master.

### Involuntary Deification

#### Antiochus II Theos: 286–246 BC

Seleucid ruler. The younger son of Antiochus I and Stratonice, succeeded his father in 261. He liberated Ephesus, Ionia, Cilicia and Pamphylia from Egyptian domination, and in return for their autonomy the cities of Asia Minor gave him the title Theos (“God”).

Rastas say that his royal titles (i.e. King of Kings, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, and Root of David) were prophesied as belonging to the returned Messiah in Revelation 5:5. Their faith in his divinity first appeared in Jamaica, soon after his 1930 coronation in Addis Ababa. Before his coronation he was called Ras (meaning Prince) Tafari.

#### Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, Duke of Edinburgh: 1921–

Considered a god in the village of Yaohnanen, a cargo cult in Vanuatu. See Prince Philip Movement.

#### Kumari: -?

These are little girls who are worshipped by both Hindus and Buddhists as the incarnation of the Hindu Goddess Durga (Nepali Taleju) in Nepal. They are picked when they are prepubescent and are worshipped until they reach puberty. Their cult is in South Asian countries, especially in Nepal.

#### George W Bush: 2000 –

For a president that had controversy surrounding him at every turn, and now gets his face plastered regularly with “Miss Me Yet?” At this point it doesn’t matter if he is guilty or innocent of treason, it is worst the people that still reminisce about him being president, and Clinton before him.

#### Barry Husain Obama: 2008 – 2016 (Limiting this entry to his presidency)

Where do we start this? The media assigned title of “The messiah”; “You didn’t build that”; 54 states; and any hundreds of gaffs, including the enslavement act called Obamacare.

See? This deification isn’t limited to the dead, but to the living. Again think about who you are worshipping, and didn’t realize it. What are you watching that is more important than God and your liberty? What is more important than taking care of those things that you are given to steward? How long do you need to Hero worship before you realize that this is idolatry?

### Self Deification

#### Antiochus IV Epiphanes: 215–164 BC

Seleucid ruler (reigned 175-164); the only Seleucid king to claim divine honors, calling himself Theos Epiphaneus “God Manifest” and Nikephoros “Bringer of Victory.” Nearly conquered Ptolemaic Egypt, the primary rival of the Seleucids among the Diadochi states. Famously attempted to impose ancient Greek religion on the Jews by persecution, leading to the Maccabean Revolt; remembered as a major persecutor in Jewish tradition.

#### Simon Magus: 1st century

Considered a god in Simonianism. According to Irenaeus, he “was glorified by many as if he were a god; and he taught that it was himself who appeared among the Jews as the Son, but descended in Samaria as the Father while he came to other nations in the character of the Holy Spirit. He represented himself, in a word, as being the loftiest of all powers, that is, the Being who is the Father over all, and he allowed himself to be called by whatsoever title men were pleased to address him.”

He was a figure who mixed marketing European eels with proselytism. His followers also considered him a living God on a mission against evil.

#### Jim Jones: 1931–1978

Founder of Peoples Temple, which started off as a part of a mainstream Protestant denomination before becoming a personality cult as time went on. One of Jones’s devotees claimed that Jones said “If you see me as your savior, I’ll be your savior. If you see me as your God, I’ll be your God”; however Jones also described himself as atheist.

#### Yahweh ben Yahweh: 1935–2007

He was born as Hulon Mitchell, Jr. and his self-proclaimed name means “God, Son of God.” He could have only been deeming himself son of God, not God, but many of his followers clearly consider him God Incarnate.

#### Vissarion: 1961–

Claims to be Jesus Christ returned, which makes him not “God” but the “word of God”.

### Church Entities

It isn’t limited to government, but also church. Did you see those people? Every man who claims a title that isn’t written is setting himself up for worship.
Even the Christ Child, Jesus
#### Jesus: ~4 BC – ~33 AD

(Included due to Wikipedia, and I added some notes. Don’t get frustrated until you read to the bottom of the notes. I’ll try to make myself clear as I go.)

In Romans 1 Paul the Apostle described Jesus as being the Son of God and the Lord. Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria wrote in defense of the divinity of the Holy Spirit. Orthodox Christianity adopted his teachings at the First Council of Nicaea in a Synod assembly of bishops in 325 AD called by the Roman emperor Constantine the Great.

Over time, with the composition and establishment of the Nicene and Athanasian creeds, Jesus was declared God Incarnate. He is now considered to be divine in most Christian views of Jesus; God the Son in Trinitarian Christianity.

Further information: History of early Christianity, Pauline Christianity, Constantine the Great and Christianity and Christology.

I have a personal problem with this declaration. God of the old and New Testament always says I am God, or I am your God, but Jesus said “When you see me, you see my Father”. Also God said that we cannot see Him face to face, but men saw Jesus face to face. Lastly John 1:1 was a very romantic way of saying that God knew what was going to be in His law and what His son was going to be like before the foundation of the world, because he set them according to His own heart.

##### John 1

>1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2. The same was in the beginning with God. 3. All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made. 4. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. 5. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

Keep note of this, we will look at verse 5 again in a moment.

Am I denying the Deification of Christ, or that God set the Lord Jesus as the Head of the body of Christ, or that the nature of the creation of Christ Jesus wasn’t divine? No. I am saying that in the scriptures, there is no word trinity, and the older translations of God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are not written the way they are in modern form starting with the lack of punctuation, chapters, and verses. I am saying that this shouldn’t be handled in this book, but I wanted you to have enough information to be enticed into doing your own study into the scriptures yourself, and not just take another person’s word for it. Study to show yourself approved, a workman, rightly dividing the word of truth 2 Timothy 2:15. Since we know that the scriptures are filled with metaphors, how much of this is metaphor and how much is literal? How much is an orientalism (a statement of speech, “This ring is as big as a house”, vs literal)? This is why I refer you to 2nd Timothy. If you don’t read it yourself, then how do you know what is written? How do you know that you are being told the truth?

I will say I won’t call Christ Jesus anything other than what is written, for the same reason I don’t call our current president Messiah or King, except in ridicule, and I won’t ridicule the first of many, the head of the body of Christ, the Lamb of God, the Christ Jesus.

Now let’s look at verse 5, the darkness doesn’t comprehend that light. This is why we are even talking about this. When you walk by the government you are walking by the darkness of this world. If you are walking by the light of others teaching, then you are walking also in their shadows of their mistakes. But if you come to God directly, then you allow Him to provide your light. I can only show you what is reflected from me. You now have the knowledge to come to him directly, and learn from both what he has written, and what he reveals to you directly. Just remember to test all new knowledge, all new wisdom, against the knowledge of Christ in the scriptures. This is how you know that the wisdom and knowledge is from God.
Why review this

## Government is the epitome of an evil false religion with an evil god. It is idolatry.

* Government collects tithes, but by force.
* Government has its high priests, the modern Pharisees and Sadducees called Judges and Legislators.
* Government has its modern prophets called Corporate Media.
* Finally government has its own high of high priests, in the USA that is the President.
* The Government has its own enforcement agency called police and military.
* They strike down their pagans and heretics by calling them terrorists and criminals.
* Anyone who tries to keep what they earned, and labored for, get raided because they failed to pay their compulsory tithes, which by mangling the language they call voluntary.
* We have multiple temples, and obligatory worship service. These include government offices, unpaid mandatory jury service, and draft.
* But let’s not forget some people volunteer to serve this evil church via:
  * Paid Police Service, that we are being forced to pay so that they can enforce laws that infringe on our natural rights.
  * Paid Inspectors, Labor Managers, Permitting Services, and other government employees, all of which are designed to tell us what we cannot do with our money and property.
  * Military, which is now nothing more than a means to generate money to the military industrial sector. Perfectly healthy, both physically and mentally, people coming back home with missing body parts and damaged perceptions of reality.
      * Not all are coming home in pieces, if they were, we would have not new volunteers. No, the idea is to keep the numbers down as far as possible, so that recruitment is high enough to make sure that the government can strip these perfectly healthy people of their human nature, which is needed for war, then return them to the public when done. All damage included.
      * If you really want to see peace in any region that is in an escalating conflict, look at who is funding the effort, and where the money is going. In the end, you will discover that whenever you have a large standing military, you will always find a reason to use it.

### Is man's government always wrong, or always seeking war?

Let’s look at Pearl Harbor

Book: Day of Deceit: The Truth About FDR and Pearl Harbor by Robert Stinnett

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Deceit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Deceit)

This book proposes that FDR knew about the planned attack and even had warning, but chose to do nothing, so that he could use the attack as a means to bring the US into a Euro-Asia war. However, there are strong arguments from historian Donald Steury that claim that the book is complete fiction. My position on this, the core of the story smells too much like other events like the Alamo, The twin Towers, and other “Government Failures”.

Something to note: This topic is big enough in Wikipedia that it took two entries to cover everything.

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_advance-knowledge_conspiracy_theory)

I will not cover the 911 theories and conspiracies here, they are a side track to the message.
###Let’s go back about two thousand years.

There was this man called Jesus, before he was even born the king of the time, Herod, decided that he didn’t want to lose his throne to this child, and decided to have all first born males killed.

Try again a few years later, the same child is now a man, and preaching not punishment under the law, but forgiveness, and condemns the men who would judge him by their own laws.

Now going for strike three, they pay off one of Jesus’ own men, to turn him in, so that they may “discuss with him”, but rather take him to be punished. That same man, who did no evil, who only preached love, peace, and compassion from God, was put to death by ballot, the people chose the free the murderer rather than the savior. He we beaten for crimes that he did not commit. He was tortured for the appeasement of the crowd. Finally, with the blessings of the mob, crucified. And we have this level of corruption now.

**NOTE:** If you are a government employee, you will most likely be unsettled by these next several paragraphs of this chapter. Just remember your actions reveal your nature, not your title. So if you have a Godly nature, then you have nothing to worry about.

How many innocent people have their lives ruined because of government agencies like Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco, Internal Revenue Service, Environmental Protection Agency. Let’s not forget the police shooting database:

* [http://regressing.deadspin.com/deadspin-police-shooting-database-update-were-still-go-1627414202](http://regressing.deadspin.com/deadspin-police-shooting-database-update-were-still-go-1627414202)

I am not saying that all police shootings are amoral, but because of public and free media, they are definitely becoming more to light. The thin blue line in some counties and cities look more like outlines of the dead bodies that the police are leaving behind. I fortunately live in a city where this is incredibly minimal. Heck, I even have a couple of local police officers that I call friends. Does that mean I condone local police? I condone it a lot more than federal police.

Let’s go back to where we left off two thousand years ago. So the local government of the Jews decided that they had enough of the Jesus character, now that he had been dead for a while, and started killing his new and old followers. Then one of these killers of the followers sees the light, both figuratively and literally. He learns of his mistakes, then becomes one of the greatest of the leaders of this Love, Peace, and liberty from the punishment of the Mosaic Law; we know him as Saul, also as Paul. So what happens to him when he returns to his starting point? They try to kill him again, and again and again. Each time he fought one government with the other. He was a Roman by birth, so no official could kill him except if found guilty in court. And he had demanded his right to be tried by Caesar, the highest of the rules of man.

So was government the solution, or the problem here? Government is such a fickled deity that it is both an enemy and a tool. When fighting a hydra, pit each head against the other, and you only have to fight the remaining head. Also note that one of these governments wasn’t the Roman government, but the ruling Hierarchy of the Jewish people. The man appointed king of the Jews, who by all rights, had no authority to carry out an execution. If you go so far as check the history of this, you will also see that there is a lot of in-playing of marriages and bloodlines from the first Herod to the last. Sounds like today’s Oligarchy doesn’t it?

Even now, we have this level of in-playing. More than one generation of politician from a single family. Expanding to reflect dynasties. Corporate executives serving as government officials, just so that they can return to new corporate positions, or become lobbyists. What sickens me even more, are these false prophets that tout God on the podium, just so that they can do the exact opposite of what is in the word of God, and get praised by the blinded followers waiving their ballots and dollar bills heralding in their great new savior. BLAPHEMY! You hypocrites that turn and run from God to worship and see this new god, who isn’t a god, but is a poison of an asp. And you drink it willingly, saying, “It makes my pain go away, and I don’t have to think.” You who would vote to have freedom stolen from others to feed your stomach are no better than the rats that eat from your plates. You are the problem, not just the politicians, not just the people who they hire, but you too.

## Summary to take from this:

* If your country is so shady, and filled with secrets that you see conspiracies in the actions of daily men, doing daily deeds, then you are already a slave to fear.
* If your work is to protect the people but all you see are criminals, then you are already a slave to fear and hate.
* If your idea of protecting people is to remove the liberties of others, then you are part of the problem.
* If you believe that because of a magical piece of paper, called a ballot, a law, a constitution, or a dollar bill, grants you the moral right to infringe on the rights of others, then you are the problem.

As a God fearing Christian, what will you do to end your participation in being part of the problem?
