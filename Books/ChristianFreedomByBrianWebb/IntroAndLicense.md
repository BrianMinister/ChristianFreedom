# Intro
The purpose of this book is to help you realize three things:
1. When Jesus Christ said it is finished, he ment it.
2. When God said have not king, 2nd Sam 8, He ment that.
3. When God said he would provide for us by the glory of His sufficiency, the ment that too.

So, do you believe God, or do you call him a liar?
