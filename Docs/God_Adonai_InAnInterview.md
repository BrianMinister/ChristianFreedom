God (Adonai), in an interview. “How harsh am I do the tribe of Israel? Are you kidding? I gave them written wisdom, direct guidance, wise men, seers, prophets, and judges. They could not keep the most straightforward commandment of Do not worship other gods before me. How harsh is that?

Oh sure, plagues hit them, and I accepted credit, but it was because I am the fiery hedge of protection. I am the high authority over all of creation. All the angels are at my call, even those who chose to try to defy me. I drew the circle that I asked them to stay in and said that if you trespass into lands beyond what I have declared for you, you will leave my protection. Of course, this is a metaphor, If I say you may do anything as long as you accept me as the one and only true God, then you are fulfilling the promise.

The problem is that they did not believe that the adversary is out to devour them. The false gods are nothing more than devils and demons. When you leave my protection, you enter the mouth of the enemy.

Even then, I am quick to forgive the one who repents of their sins. So I establish Israel and see to it that their tribe grows significantly, and they defy me and give my glory to dirt that is golden in color. So I give my blessing to their heirs, and they too, after seeing my high power, seek after idols and false gods, giving my glory to them. So I withhold my protection again. This is my great wrath: I will allow my enemy to devour those who have chosen to run into the sword and mouth of my enemy while ignoring me, their God of protection.

Finally, when the disobedient have become so ugly to me, so the point that I know that they would be lost to me, I sent my son, who volunteered to redeem them to me when I asked. How beloved is my son, who gave himself at the cross, so that he would prove his obedience to the point of resurrecting three days and nights later?

Look at this like a gardener or a farmer. When your seed is clean and unadulterated, you keep it clean by removing all of the bad seeds. This provides future crops with more grain. But Israel is no longer a pure bloodline. I have used this to prepare the way for the tribes of Israel to spread out to the corners of the world.

My son, of the protected bloodline of David, the root of Jesse, is the first seed of a new harvest. Unlike the old harvest, which was of bloodline, and law, the new harvest is of grace and holy spirit, the new covenant. Jesus (Yeshua) is the first because all must come to me through the alpha and be harvested at the omega.

This is my new Kingdom, the people who are mine for an inheritance, and I am theirs as their father in the true birth and in their inheritance. They are the heirs to my Kingdom and my throne.

Am I harsh? I am harsh to dirt. I am harsh to those who are perishing. I am harsh to those who stand against me. No man that is without me is greater than dirt. Yes, I am harsh, because I don’t want dirt, I want children who have learned their power and authority over this dirt, and know that this comes from me. I give it to them lovingly, knowing that they cannot abuse it, because they cannot use my right hand outside of the nature of my right hand. They cannot use my power outside of my nature. To claim you can use my power for something that I am not, means that you are demonstrating power that I am not. You are being deceived by the adversary.

Am I harsh? You betcha! I want the best for my children, and I want them to know the best, so I am going to be consistent and loving to them, yet firm in my boundaries, and fast with my loving grace. Beware, and be ready, for those who claim me may not be of me, but I will always claim those who are of me, and they are mine, and I am jealous over them.

So yea, I am harsh, for I am.”

The Atheist interviewer sits there, mouth open, and utters, “Sorry…”
