God (Adonai), in an interview. “How harsh am I do the tribe of Israel? Are you kidding? I gave them written wisdom, direct guidance, wise men, seers, prophets, and judges, and they could not keep the simplest commandment of Do not worship other gods before me. How harsh is that?

Oh sure plagues hit them, and I accepted credit, but it was because I am the fiery hedge of protection. I am the great authority over all of creation. All the angels are at my call, even those who chose to try to defy me. I drew the circle that I asked them to stay in, and said that if you trespass into lands beyond what I have declared for you, then you leave my protection. Of course this is a metaphor, If I say you may so anything as long as you accept me as the one and only true God then you are fulfilling the promise.

The problem is that they did not believe that the advisory is out to devour them. The false gods are nothing more than devils and demons. When you leave my protection, you enter the mouth of the enemy.

Even then, I am quick to forgive the one who repents of their sins. So I establish Israel, and see to it that their tribe grows greatly, and they defy me, and give my glory to dirt that is golden in color. So I give my blessing to their heirs, and they too, after seeing my great power, seek after idols and false gods, giving my glory to them. So I withhold my protection again. This is my great wrath, in that I will allow my enemy to devour those who have chosen to run into the mouth of my enemy.

Finally when the disobedient have become so ugly to me, so the point that I know that they would be lost to me, I sent my son, who volunteered to redeem them to me, when I asked. How beloved is my son, who gave himself at the cross, so that he would prove his obedience to the point of resurrecting three days and nights later.

Look at this like a gardener, or a farmer. When your seed is clean, and unadulterated, you keep it clean by removing all of the bad seed. This provides future crops with more seed. But Israel is no longer a pure bloodline. This has become a strength, in that it prepared the way for the tribe of Israel to spread out to the corners of the world.

My son, of the protected bloodline of David, the root of Jesse, is the first seed of a new harvest. Unlike the old harvest, which was of flesh, and law, the new harvest is of grace, and holy spirit. Jesus (Yeshua) is the first, because all must come to me through the alpha, and will be harvested at the omega.

This is my new Kingdom, the people who are mine for an inheritance, and I am theirs as their father in the true birth and in their inheritance. They are the heirs to my kingdom and my throne.

Am I harsh, I am harsh to dirt. I am harsh to those who are perishing. I am harsh to those who stand against me. No man that is without me is greater than dirt. Yes I am harsh, because I don’t want dirt, I want children who have learned their power and authority over this dirt, and know that this come from me. I give it to them lovingly, knowing that they cannot abuse it, because they cannot use my right hand outside of the nature of my right hand. They cannot use my power outside of my nature. To claim you can use my power for something that I am not means that you are demonstrating power that I am not. You are being deceived by the advisory.

Am I harsh? You betcha! I want the best for my children, and I want them to know the best, so I am going to be consistent and loving to them, yet firm in my boundaries, and fast with my loving grace. Beware, and be ready, for those who claim me may not be of me, but I will always claim those who are of me, and they are mine, and I am jealous over them.

So yea, I am harsh, for I am.”

Atheist interviewer sits there, mouth open, and utters “Sorry…”
