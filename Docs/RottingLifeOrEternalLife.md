I keep watching and seeing what is real and what is distraction. It is all distraction. If life were real then why would everything be as temporary as the dirt that we grew out from?

> Genesis 2:7 Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.

Can anything from dirt be permanent? Can anything made from dirt ever be clean?

> Isaiah 64:6 For all of us have become like one who is unclean,
> And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment;
> And all of us wither like a leaf,
> And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.

How then can I be saved from the nature and destiny of dirt? How can one who is destined to wither and blow us away survive, and persevere?

> Rom 3:9 What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin; 10 as it is written,
> "THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE;
> 11 THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS,
> THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD;
> 12 ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS;
> THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD,
> THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE.”
> 13 “THEIR THROAT IS AN OPEN GRAVE,
> WITH THEIR TONGUES THEY KEEP DECEIVING,”
> “THE POISON OF ASPS IS UNDER THEIR LIPS”;
> 14 “WHOSE MOUTH IS FULL OF CURSING AND BITTERNESS”;
> 15 “THEIR FEET ARE SWIFT TO SHED BLOOD,
> 16 DESTRUCTION AND MISERY ARE IN THEIR PATHS,
> 17 AND THE PATH OF PEACE THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN.”
> 18 “THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE THEIR EYES.”
> 19 Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the world may become accountable to God; 20 because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.

Are we doomed to sin? NO!

> Rom3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; 25 whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith.

The word “propitiation” is interesting, in that it means atonement. If you have a judgement or debt against you, and someone else pays it off, then they paid the propitiation of that debt for you. You owe nothing.

Meaning, the time served being lashed, tortured, hung on the cross, and buried in the tomb, was full payment for your sins. His last words were *it is done*, not *it is done, except*.

So by the love of our Lord, please accept what was done for you at the cross in your daily lives. Even Romans 12:2 tells us to be transformed by the renewing of our minds. This isn’t us changing ourselves, self help books done help anyone but the writer and the publisher, with minor exceptions. This is God, the Father, Adonai (by the Hebrew name), Elohim (Hebrew for the Highest of the high, also the source of the plurality of God’s name) that has decided that he wanted you so badly that he supplied the lamb for the sacrifice, the high priest to perform the sacrifice, just so that you could come unto Him through Christ Jesus (Hebrew name would be the Messiah Yeshua). Don’t turn away His gift.
