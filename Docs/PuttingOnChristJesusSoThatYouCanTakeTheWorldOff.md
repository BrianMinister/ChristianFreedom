# Putting on Christ Jesus so that you can take the world off
I'm going to let the word speak for itself here. Every time I try to add my own commentary, I get moved off of the work.

I will come back to this and redo it as a spider diagram.

## Renewed Mind
> **Rom 12:2**  And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. 

## Depth of God's love
> **Rom 8:35-39**  Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? **36**  Just as it is written, "FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL DAY LONG; WE WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED." **37** But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us. **38** For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, **39** nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. 

## Depth of God's power

> **Rom 2:12-29**  For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish without the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law; **13**  for it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified. **14**  For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, **15**  in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them, **16**  on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the secrets of men through Christ Jesus. 

>**17** But if you bear the name "Jew" and rely upon the Law and boast in God, **18**  and know His will and approve the things that are essential, being instructed out of the Law, **19**  and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, **20**  a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth, **21**  you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal? **22**  You who say that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? **23**  You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you dishonor God? **24**  For "THE NAME OF GOD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE GENTILES BECAUSE OF YOU," just as it is written. 

>**25**  For indeed circumcision is of value if you practice the Law; but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. **26**  So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? **27**  And he who is physically uncircumcised, if he keeps the Law, will he not judge you who though having the letter of the Law and circumcision are a transgressor of the Law? **28**  For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. **29**  But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God. 

## Working with God's word
### Bread
> **John 6:33**  "For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world."

> **John 6:35**  Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never thirst.

> **Revelations 22:1**  Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb,

> **Revelations 22:17**  The Spirit and the bride say, "Come." And let the one who hears say, "Come." And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes take the water of life without cost.

### Rock
#### Fortress, Shelter
> **2 Samuel 22:2**  He said, "The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; **3**  My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge; My savior, You save me from violence.

> **2 Samuel 23:3**  "The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me, 'He who rules over men righteously, Who rules in the fear of God,

> **Psalms 18:31**  For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God,

> **Psalms 18:46**  The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God of my salvation,

> **Psalms 19:14**  Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in Your sight, O LORD, my rock and my Redeemer.

> **Psalms 78:35**  And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their Redeemer.

> **Psalms 89:26**  "He will cry to Me, 'You are my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.'

> **Psalms 92:15**  To declare that the LORD is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.

> **Psalms 95:1**  O come, let us sing for joy to the LORD, Let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation.

> **Mathew 7:24**  "Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock. **25**  "And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.

> **Mathew 16:18**  "I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.

> **Romans 9:33**  just as it is written, "BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."

> **1 Corinthians 10:4**  and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.

> **1 Peter 2:8**  and, "A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE"; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed.

#### Hide
