# The end times. A Mathew 24 walkthough.

## The pretense of this chapter.

> 1 Jesus came out from the temple and was going away when His disciples came up to point out the temple buildings to Him. 2 And He said to them, “Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, not one stone here will be left upon another, which will not be torn down.”
Mathew 24:1 NASB

This was Yeshua (Jesus) telling us what was going to happen soon. Moreover, on Av 9, it was torn down as retaliation from the Zealots’ actions who were following a false messiah.

## The Question

> 3 As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?”
Mathew 24:2 NASB

Here are three questions from the Disciples:
* When will these happen
* What will be the sign of your coming
* [What will be the sign] of the end of the age

## The first part of the answer

>4 And Jesus answered and said to them, “See to it that no one misleads you. 5 For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will mislead many. 6 You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet the end. 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes. 8 But all these things are merely the beginning of birth pangs.
Mathew 24:4-8 NASB

So we have instructions and warnings.
* Instruction: See to it that no one misleads you.
* Warning: Many will come in my name, saying “I am the Christ” and will mislead many.
* Warning: Hearing of wars and rumors of wars.
* Instruction: Do not be frightened, these things must take place, but that is NOT yet the end.
  * Note that people thought that WW1 and WW2 were the end. So it is evident that wars are not the end, but just a sign.
* Warning: Nation will rise against nation
  * The word nation is the word ethnos, where we get ethnic and ethnicity from. A group of people of one kind. Not necessarily race, but it could be race too.
  * Look at our race troubles across the world. Not just race, but religion is being used to attack people too. There is no limit to the horrors that people will use excuses to afflict onto another.
* Warning: Kingdom against Kingdom
* Kingdom comes from basileia, a territory or subject under the rule of a king.
  * US vs. China, and before that US vs. Russia. State of California vs. the people. The state of Michigan vs the people.
* Warning: Famines and Earthquakes
* What to take from this: Take no heed, because these are just birthing pains of things to come.
  * Birthing pains need more details of what that means. As the contractions get closer, they get more intense and painful. Not that they get closer together as they continue. We can see this in the events that used to be annual are now monthly, and we can expect them to become weekly soon.

This is the summary of the answer to question 1. All of those things have to happen, but they will get worse and more frequent until birth.

## The second part of the answer

9 “Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name. 10 At that time many will fall away and will betray one another and hate one another. 11 Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many. 12 Because lawlessness is increased, most people’s love will grow cold. 13 But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved. 14 This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
Mathew 24:9-14 NASB

So verse 9 must pick up the next question, what will be the sign of his coming?
* will deliver you to tribulation
* will kill you
* you will be hated by all nations
* many will fall away
* will betray one another
* hate one another
* false prophets will arise
* will mislead many
* lawlessness is increased
* love will grow cold.

Again this word Nations is the word ethnos. You will be hated by ethnic groups.

The government intervention into daily lives is causing us to be delivered into tribulations. People are being killed on all political stands. We are seeing a new ethnic war going on. People are turning from God to en mass. We have a new term for people that turn in their neighbors, calling them Karens. We are seeing neighbors attacking neighbors, including a process that is called “swatting” and doxing. How many new prophets of new religions have come up? How many people have are being led into new religions of death? Look at the movement of AntiFa, the most fascist people around, and the BLM organization run by self-proclaimed Marxists. Moreover, finally, we would rather see a person starve and die on a park bench than to help them out. How many homeless do there need to be before one realized that the solution could never be to sweep them under the carpets of government action, but the people need to be helped in ways that cause a lasting solution?

Now we get to the answer to question 2, what is the sign? All of that above, then, those who endure will be saved. However, this is also where we see the 3rd answer to the question about the end of the age. Again, nation is an ethnic group, and the word will reach all of them, then the end will come.

Do not think that this is the worst of it. Because it is in these times, we will see the Abomination of Desolation. This is a metaphor, and it is the completed beast of the accumulation of beasts as prophesied in Daniel.

However, isn’t this after the end of the above? If you know how the old Hebrew texts read, the outline is given first, then pertinent details. This was self-evident in both Leviticus and Deuteronomy. However, it happened throughout the Torah.

## Digging into the answers with details of events

15 “Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), 16 then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. 17 Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the things out that are in his house. 18 Whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak. 19 But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 20 But pray that your flight will not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath. 21 For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will. 22 Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. 23 Then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or ‘There He is,’ do not believe him. 24 For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect. 25 Behold, I have told you in advance. 26 So if they say to you, ‘Behold, He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or, ‘Behold, He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe them. 27 For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be. 28 Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.
Mathew 24:15-28 NASB

### Revealing the details of the 3rd answer
This segment is truly written to the Jews, but I have broken it into two sections. The first part had happened when Israel was sacked, and the 2nd temple torn down. The second part we see again and again. However, bible prophesies tend to repeat themselves. So we will see 15-22 happen again, just as we regularly see 23 – 28 happen.

> 29 “But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF THE SKY with power and great glory. 31 And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.
Mathew 24:29-31 NASB

The moon and stars were given to be a calendar of times, seasons, and dates. They are to mark events. Sun darkening, and the moon not reflecting, is most likely a lunar eclipse. Moreover, it is probably an eclipse that will happen during one of the seasonal meteor showers when they have the highest number of falling stars. https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/meteor-shower/list.html.

Yeshua is called the son of man and son of God, and many other titles, such as the lamb of God. In this time, he will be coming, and his power and glory will be seen. The angels report to Him, and he will send his angels out with a great trumpet to gather that which is his. This is why the rash of horn sounds that we keep hearing on Youtube and other sites are just more false messiahs. We hear the horns, but we don’t see the glory of the messiah in the sky. We don’t see his angels come down to gather that which is his.

I am sorry that I am going to rush through the rest of this. You deserve a more detailed walkthrough, but I need to finish this tonight. So I am going to rush it.

### Now what do we do with this information?

> 32 “Now learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near; 33 so, you too, when you see all these things, recognize that He is near, right at the door. 34 Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.
> 
> 36 “But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone. 37 For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah. 38 For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39 and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be. 40 Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. 41 Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left.
Mathew 24:32-41 NASB

The parable of the fig tree is simple, just as you can look at a fig tree to see that summer is coming, you now have been given the signs of His return, and you need to act accordingly.

However, we don’t know the day or hour? Sure, we don’t. However, we can see it. Just as we can see a hungry lion act more and more fierce before it is fed, we will see the signs of the return happen before us, in greater magnitude and frequency.

Just as the sign of the flood was in the blessings in the hands of Noah’s work, we see that the signs of the return are coming upon us. The masses won’t understand, and yet, when it happens, it will be strange to the ones left behind because it will be as if two were there, and in an instant, one is missing.

### Be diligent with this information

> 42 “Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming. 43 But be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. 44 For this reason you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think He will.
> 
> 45 “Who then is the faithful and sensible [servant] whom his master put in charge of his household to give them their food at the proper time? 46 Blessed is that [servant] whom his master finds so doing when he comes. 47 Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions. 48 But if that evil [servant] says in his heart, ‘My master is not coming for a long time,’ 49 and begins to beat his fellow [servant] and eat and drink with drunkards; 50 the master of that [servant] will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know, 51 and will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Mathew 24:42-51 NASB

I need you to understand this last section: Be on the alert.
* You do not know which day your Lord is coming.
* if the head of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into
* For this reason, you also must be ready;
* the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think He will.
* Be faithful and sensible.
* then is the faithful and sensible [servant] whom his master put in charge of his household
* to give them their food at the proper time? (That is to take care of the household.
* Blessed is that [servant] whom his master finds so doing when he comes.
* Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.

Don’t be evil in your heart.
* But if that evil [servant] says in his heart, 
* ‘My master is not coming for a long time,’ 
* begins to beat his fellow [servants] 
* eat and drink with drunkards; (The exact opposite of the good servant.)
* the master of that [servant] will come on a day when he does not expect him 
* at an hour which he does not know, 
* will cut him in pieces 
* assign him a place with the hypocrites; 
* in that place, there will be weeping 
* gnashing of teeth.

Let’s assume that in the last part of this ("will cut him in pieces" though "gnashing of teeth"), there is more meaning to this because there is. However, do you really want to be there? Obviously, it isn’t a party zone.

God bless, and take care.
